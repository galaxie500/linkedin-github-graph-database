https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanlattanzi/,,"I graduated Washington State University with an MS in Mathematics, and have been working as a data engineer for the past few years. Even though I went to school to be a data scientist, my passion has evolved to data engineering - building scalable pipelines that ingest, run ETL, and spit out production ready data. I think most data scientists are thrown a similar curveball when first breaking into the industry and it's because most places that want to do data science don't yet have data! Although intimidated at first, I have come to love and embrace the engineering role, realizing the importance of developing solid software engineering principles in order to build bulletproof applications. On the horizon for me is to learn more about Docker and Kubernetes, Spark (through EMR and PySpark), Airflow, streaming services (Kafka, Kinesis), and Golang.

I love my job, I love the people I work with, and I'm forever grateful to those who have guided me along the way. As I'm always learning new things, I would love to connect to discuss theories, business, or anything else!

- Architect a standardized solution across multiple teams to serve as the central data repository.
- Use Terraform to set up a repeatable infrastructure on AWS for any new teams that may pop up. Includes creating S3 buckets and configuring their properties to send event notifications to SQS, altering the SQS access policy to allow communication, and setting up Glue tables.
- Host open source spaCy NLP models (14 languages) on AWS EFS to be called via API Gateway and Lambda functions. This allows for CI/CD of production models.
- Lead a project to host prodigy (https://prodi.gy) on EC2 to allow data labeling for better model inference.
- Create other Python applications that ingest data via batch REST API calls and application databases that ultimately push raw data to AWS on a schedule (cron and Windows Task Scheduler). Hosted on EC2 and other relevant networks.
- Productionize a scalable consumer-facing Levenshtein-based fuzzy string matcher microservice via Lambda. Ran large scaled parallelized tests with Sagemaker to determine ~98% precision and ~60% recall - but this worked for our use case as we wanted to optimize precision.
- Set up email alerts using SNS, Lambda, and SES to inform a key email list about system failures.
- Use API Gateway and Lambda to expose our data in a controlled manner.
- Work with SQL to construct stored procedures and views to enhance data for analysts.
- Build dashboards in Tableau that portray data in meaningful and insightful ways for the client.
- Work towards quantifying what has been considered qualitative to come up with objective measurements that can capture the effectiveness of our work.

My job as a Data Engineer at BOSE made me the kind of person I am today with the quench of learning more and more. I deal with multiple data sets at bose, do validation checks on them, check the archives and most importantly design and Implemented ETL for data load from SAP HANA as source database and Snowflake as Target Database, creating ETL jobs for  data exchange, noting these observations and running the records everyday are some of my responsibilities. 

My first job as a Business Data Analyst Intern made me realize ""Creating scalable solutions starts with scalable systems and business models"". I stepped into the corporate world and learnt to define Business Requirements, create visualizations using Tableau, code in SQL, Python, stakeholder analysis and knowledge of other data structures and development of new functionality and therefore learned how to work on data and information effectively. 

Also, I want to collaborate with a non-profit, work with them and help them in whatever way I can.

Think like a proton! Always positive.

- I always believe that the highest levels of performance come to people who are intuitive, creative and reflective - people who know to see a problem as an opportunity; Just as an Ideal Data Scientist who wake up with a million bytes of data every day to deal with. (Torture the data, and it will CONFESS to anything)
-From a kid who fond to solve every random puzzle in the last page of the weeklies to a professional who loves to play with the data, my obsession towards data exponentially grew up.
-I always fancied to incorporate the potentiality of technology with the complexities of people. Data, if modelled into the desirable interpretations can complement human decisions for speed, ease and quality. It is my objective to build systems and products that make this happen.
-Over the years, I have been learning various topics associated with Data Science. My prime programming languages are Python and R.
-From my past experiences and academic learning, I have obtained skills in finding the insights hidden in huge data, performing statistical analysis, data cleaning, data modeling and delivering products based on customer-centric solutions.  In my recent past, I have undertaken various projects using R, Python, Statistics and Machine Learning.
-Worked closely with Data Engineers and product management to turn data analysis into actionable algorithms and applications.
-Practical knowledge in mathematical software, databases, programming languages, and comfortable working with large data sets (R/Python/SQL).
-Solid understanding of Various machine learning techniques including Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Linear and Logistic Regressions, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and K Means Clustering.
-Well versed in python libraries: scikit-learn, NumPy, tensorflow, matplotlib.

Project: Optimizing Recommender Systems At Scale
Mentor: Prof Julian McAuley

• This project lies at the intersection of state-of-the-art ML systems research and recommender systems
• Historically, this is an area that hasn't received much academic or industry attention which is reflected by the fact that only 2% of papers published are related to Recommender Systems.
• This is still a very important field given the ubiquity of recommender systems in most major online platforms and how computationally intensive they tend to be.
• In this project, I study and develop better ways to deploy recommender systems at scale efficiently by taking into account things like query arrival patterns and query sizes to utilize computational resources much more effectively.","La Jolla, California",Jan 2021 – Present,University of California San Diego,Bachelor of Science - BS,"Featured Student on the HDSI Website - https://rebrand.ly/devanshu-featureCapstone Project - 'AutoBrick: A system for end-to-end automation of building point labels to Brick turtle files'Preprint: https://rebrand.ly/autobrick-preprintMentor: Prof. Rajesh GuptaRelevant Coursework:Graduate -• Advanced Computer Vision [In Progress]• Recommender Systems, Web Mining, and Predictive Analytics• Computational Biology• Deep Learning• AI: Search And Reasoning [In Progress]Undergraduate - • Systems for Scalable Analytics• Product Management and Marketing• Advanced Algorithms for Data Science (audited)• Data Management• Data Visualization• Machine Learning and Statistical Approaches to Artificial Intelligence• Practice and Applications of Data Science• Statistical Algorithms and Modern Machine Learning Methods• Exploratory Data Analysis and Inference• Statistical Methods• Algorithms, Programming and Data Structures for Data Science• Linear Algebra",Data Science,2017 – 2021,,,,,,,,,"Java, Python (Programming Language), SQL, Project Management, C++, Linux",Java,3,Python (Programming Language),3,SQL,2,Project Management,1,C++,2,Linux,2,https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbdesai-data,dbdesai-data,2021-12-05T09:07:36.765Z,https://www.linkedin.com/school/17954/?legacySchoolId=17954,,"Menlo Park, California, United States",,,,

https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-schoof-319330b3/,,"My name is Emily, and I'm a Data Scientist and Engineer. My educational background and early work experience started in healthcare, where I sought to make an impact through scientific discovery. My eventual decision to become a Data Scientist was rooted in my desire to increase my international presence and contributions with more industry-transferable skills. All of my work experience share a theme of communication, where it was essential to produce clear analytics reports that were digestible for various audiences, from scientists and physicians to stakeholders and C Suites.

Recently, I've been getting more interested in the extraction, transformation, and loading of event data from open media sources (GDELT, Reddit, Twitter, other) for developing Early Warning and Detection systems for areas of conflict. I'm fascinated by the various machine learning methodologies of extracting this information, and I'm keen on working on projects and for companies that enable me to grow and enhance my skillset in this particular subset of data modeling.

I have tailored most of my data projects and career choices towards international, philanthropic, initiatives, and I find that my work performance exceeds expectations when I am able to particulate in global initiatives that seek to improve the lives of others (in some fashion) around the world.

Premise of Task: Contextual Alert and Trend System (CATS) is a proof of concept (POC) for an automated system for near real-time media monitoring via GDELT to identify trends and anomalies in the volume of online reports about pre-defined indicator events, at country level. The tool fills a critical gap in structured risk information gathering for UNICEF’s Horizon Scan process and will support CO level risk management activities. This POC follows an analysis of existing tools that finds no appropriate products.

Outcomes
1. Validate ability to accurately identify anomaly and trends using statistical analysis
2. Provide structured information gathering and alerting for UNICEF’s global Horizon Scan process

Looking back at my childhood, there was no way I could have known that my early inclination towards Computer Science and Mathematics would lead me to pursue advanced studies in Data Analytics. Today,  Here I am pursuing my Master of Science in Data Analytics Engineering at Northeastern University.

My Proclivity towards computers made me choose a major in Information Technology at SSN college of Engineering. It was while serving as an in-charge for a Data Analytics event at a National Level Symposium during my undergraduate studies, I got exposed to the data field. Since then, I actively involved myself in data analytics projects to augment my skills. To hone my skills further, I took charge as a Data Analyst Intern at CLOUDCHERRY. I explored the horizons of R and Python during this phase. As a next step, I became a part of TCS Retail Unit at Chennai as a Data Analyst Intern where I extensively worked on web scraping and image analysis. Dreaming about starting a career in data analytics, I started my professional career with L&T Infotech as a Software Engineer where I got to work on tools and technologies like Talend, Power BI, Qlik Sense, Microsoft SQL Server, Azure and many more. I got exposed to Business intelligence field in IIOT domain. 

To further enhance my knowledge, I have taken a break from my professional career and I am into my academic journey once again to learn the art of Data Analytics from scratch.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/pallabi-chakraborty/,,"I am happy when I am writing code. I am happier still when the code works. And happiest when the code transforms into an innovative solution. Trust me when I say this: I am transported to a different place when I write code and I can do it tirelessly (so long as I have some Doritos to munch on by my side). Of course nothing comes easy. There is frustration now and then, but the key lies in not giving up (and perhaps a bit of Googling). My experience has taught me no problem is beyond a solution, even if the solution is hidden behind multiple failed attempts. 
Data gives me my share of dopamine. It makes me tick. Give me data and I will start figuring out patterns, marking outliers-- in short joining the dots to reveal the whole picture. Data speaks to me like none other. I am here to decipher the cryptic language of data for those who don’t understand it. Get in touch if you want me to tell you the story the data is trying to tell.  I have more than eight years of experience in developing database and ETL programs. I have led a team of developers working on both backend development and front-end management.

My name is Manya Sangal. I am pursuing Masters in Business Analytics from The University Of Texas at Dallas with a GPA of 3.96 and working as a Business Intelligence Intern with Dewolff, Boberg and Associates. Having worked with Verizon and Ericsson for 5 years before my Masters, I now  aspire to build my career as a Business Analyst/ Data Engineer/ Data Scientist/ Business Intelligence or similar roles.

I have worked on multiple analytical projects using R and Python during my career so far. I am currently working on data integration and automation(via Talend) to develop data pipelines and perform data analysis for clients across industries. Along with being well versed with SQL and Excel, I am also confident with building dashboards and visualizations using Tableau. 

I have an International paper publication in “The Journal of Engineering Research And Technology” on the use of Analytics in Healthcare . All these experiences have helped me wear many hats and made me capable of working in an environment where no two working days are same.

Along with the above-mentioned technical expertise, I possess strong communication skills and an ability to deliver under pressure. My time management skills ensure quality delivery within deadlines.

Hi, I'm Biraj and I specialize in data engineering having 2+ years of work experience in building scalable ETL data pipelines and deploying the applications on the cloud.

Currently, working with Mckinsey & Company as a Data Engineer. Previously, I had the opportunity to work with 3 start-ups during my Master's Degree where I worked as a Machine Learning and Data Engineer. 

In the past, I had the opportunity to work with the telecommunication giant Reliance Jio as a Data Scientist where I was responsible for building robust data pipelines for ingesting petabyte of customer-centric streaming data using big data components like Apache Spark, Kafka, Hadoop, Hive, etc for a highly critical business use-case.

Also, during my tenure at Piramal Enterprises, I developed a predictive model (rule-based) for fraud detection by collaboratively working with business stakeholders.

With the blend of industry experience along with technical skills I developed during my Master’s Degree, I am keen to develop products that impact on a large scale. 𝙄 𝙖𝙢 𝙘𝙪𝙧𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙡𝙮 𝙡𝙤𝙤𝙠𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙁𝙪𝙡𝙡-𝙏𝙞𝙢𝙚 𝙟𝙤𝙗 𝙤𝙥𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙩𝙪𝙣𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙚𝙨 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙄 𝙖𝙢 𝙞𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙙 𝙞𝙣 𝘿𝙖𝙩𝙖 𝙀𝙣𝙜𝙞𝙣𝙚𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝘿𝙖𝙩𝙖 𝙎𝙘𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚 𝙧𝙤𝙡𝙚𝙨  🎯

https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhumikapanchal30/,,"Hey! How are you doing? 
Thank you for landing on my LinkedIn profile page. Before you scroll down to weigh me against my technical and leadership qualities, let me narrate my summary to you in 'About' section here.

I would love to describe myself in 5 simple points.

1. Assets: What I bring to the table? Detail-driven, creative and critical thinking, solid problem solving abilities, effective and clear communication styles, commitment of a team player, quality-rich questions, punctuality and thus the enthusiasm to reach the deadlines gracefully.

2. Education and Profession: Where did the above come from? The above qualities I mentioned are gained while I got educated and earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering and polished them well and groomed my professional communication skills as a Data Engineer when I worked for CitiusTech. I worked with my team where our goals were aligned. The drive to accomplish the tasks and deliver the best bagged me as the youngest person to receive CitiusTech Core Value award for 'Passion in All your Work'.

3. Post-graduation in US: What piqued my curiosity to resume my education after 3 yrs.? I flew to the west and landed in Texas, US to pursue MS in Business Analytics and Data Science. Data Engineering which I learned during my career path is sandwiched between Business Analytics and Data Science. If you see, these three basically form a cycle. The inputs from each one feed the other. Working with both the teams kicked my curiosity juices to gain expertise in these fields.

4. Soul foods: Read and listen (audio-books and podcasts) because it enlightens me. Cooking is my stress buster. Yoga brings the calmness to my anxiety and it helps me balance my curious nature (clarity about what things to get curious for). Singing connects me with people and teaches me to be harmonious with my surrounding. Hiking helps me pump out my creative thinking in the midst of nature. Learning new language is always fun for me and a tool to connect with people. Music is my food.

5. Prospect and Goals: To cut this short, my goal is first to be a rational human being for what I think and decide. I see my future self to be more bold and aware with respect to treatment with lots and lots of data and their veracity, to enhance myself technically, emotionally and cognitively to be a formidable data scientist and surpass my limits to become an awe-inspiring author, to never stop loving and make this world more lovely than yesterday.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/datta-tele/,,"My story is that the industrial engineer who became a self-taught Data Engineer. The knowledge of industrial engineering helped to build a foundation for data science.  The goal of an industrial engineer is to optimize the process, make the system as efficient as possible, reduce waste in every step by using tools like lean, six sigma and agile development, and fundamentally improve quality of product or process. This all needs data, understanding about data, importantly gaining insight and making an impactful decision.  

I taught myself to code and learned different methodologies in data science, code optimization, and ways to reduce speed in training process of the model. Further, I learned to develop data-driven applications.

I started off working as a research assistant in the Lamar University where, I enriched my experience in data profiling, data mining, data analysis, natural language processing, predictive modeling and application development.
