I joined Periscope to learn about explosive growth - how to scale a team, a product, and a company while they all continue to accelerate. I am super proud of how we tackle problems, drive projects, iterate quickly, and get great feedback from our customers. 

I came in not knowing any of the tech stack. On my second day I shipped a SQL autocompleter. In my first week I wrote a SQL formatter. In my first month I helped re-write our entire data processing engine. I touched all parts of the product and architecture, helped define our roadmap, and even served a stint as Editor-in-Chief of the Periscope Blog.

I'm all about making a difference to the business in the short term (six months or less). Data quality input and output issues? I know how to find & fix them. Insight into business performance? I've done that. Insight for customers to win business? That's what I do. 
I'm a VP with rock-solid data science team-building experience, a powerful data science background, and experience that cuts across the entire business. My breadth of knowledge is unique.
Check out my blog: https://blog.engora.com/","I apply data science to the data of the business for short-term business benefits. This includes:
* Analysis of cybersecurity data to produce detailed marketing content. For example, examining the cybersecurity of the oil and gas pipeline industry and comparing it to the S&P 500. 
* Analysis of the sales funnel using data science to improve the process.
* Data quality, consistency, and reporting.
* Legal and regulatory work.
I'm building a team and recruiting data scientists.","MANAGEMENT & LEADERSHIP. I built a team of 11 data scientists from the ground up, including hires in the US and Europe. I ensure the analysts and scientists who work for me develop their careers through ongoing training and coaching. My data science team has won more company awards per head than any other team.

TECHNICAL. I'm hands-on with the full data science stack: SQL, AWS, GCP, PySpark, Pandas, Bokeh, NumPy, SciPy, Databricks, Git, Qubole, etc. 

DATA QUALITY. Huge data sets are noisy and dirty. Several analysts in my group are focused on different aspects of data quality (in and out) – we fix the hard problems. 

STATISTICS. Poisson, lognormal, binomial, significance, p-values, power, z-test, … I've used it all. I know A/B tests and I know alternatives like difference-in-difference.

SELLING. My data science team uses analytics to demonstrate value to accounts at the time of sale and on an on-going basis. When I recruit, I’m careful to select people who can talk to customers and talk to non-technical people. My analysts and data scientists work hand-in-glove with sales and customer success.

LEGAL. I’m very familiar with the GDPR and US law (state and federal) and I know what it takes to be privacy compliant. I have sideline expertise in contract law.

STRATEGY. I decide what my data scientists will do and when they will do it. We work for the bigger picture.

COMMUNICATIONS. Unusually for a technical person, I love public speaking, even more unusually, I’m very good at it. I can also write.

Please visit respective GitHub Links to view the actual code and analysis.

(i) Predictive Model for Seizure Detection in Epileptic Patients| PCA | XGBOOST | Randomized Grid Search
•	Developed a very effective XG Boost model on the high dimensional brain activity record (EEG) data for epileptic patients. Devised a robust approach to handle the computational challenges because of dimensionality of data. Performed PCA followed by several baseline model to spearhead the right approach.
•	Eventually employed Randomized Grid Search to get optimal hyperparameters which delivered an accuracy of 97% which was critically higher than baseline model. Further, the Random Grid search cut down the computational time by 50%.

(ii) Future Sales Prediction of a Grocery Store | XGBoost | ANN | Ensemble Modeling
•	Built an ensemble of XG Boost and ANN model to get the optimal performance score for predicting the sales volume. Deftly handled extremely large volume of data (1 billion rows) by building the base model on random sample of a smaller fraction and then built the final model with optimal hyperparameters on whole dataset.
•	This practical approach to the huge dataset helped score in top 10% on leaderboard with  a short span of 2 weeks using the basic computing resources. Nonetheless, it helped in avoiding overfitting of the model significantly.",2015 – 2017,2006 – 2010,github.com/anil10iitr,"•	Host Heinz College Radio Show on current policy matters, interviewed a few distinguished guests ranging from top level executives like Former Chief of Staff Obama administration(Office of Science & Technology) to local government leaders like city council representatives                                                                                                                                                                        2015-2016•	Represented Carnegie Mellon University for Habitat for Humanity trip to experiential learning tour to New Mexico to closely observe the process of economic development.",- Headed Hospitality devision of IIT Roorkee SPIC MACAY chapter for during undergraduate studies at IIT Rookee. -Successfully managed the responsibility for more than 20 regional and national events.,,,,,,

As a Senior AI Executive, I build, mentor, and empower teams to help the organization grow and remove customer friction. I have a passion for establishing robust, collaborative, customer-centric organizations and efficient cost management.

I have a high degree of comfort with ambiguity and deconstructing complex problems, with a penchant for solving problems from a customer-focused lens and an intuitive sense of how the work aligns closely with business objectives.

My background includes senior roles driving knowledge-based changes supported by AI initiatives across verticals and locations for industry-leading organizations. Most recently, I increased revenues and reduced customer friction through building collaborative relationships and implementing metrics and strategies, at one of the largest retailers in the world. The impact was a rise in customer acquisition and retention with better reviews.

I’m known for my ability to detect unusual patterns/bugs, learn quickly, provide an array of trial solutions, communicate effectively with all levels and create impressive results.

I have a background in biochemisty and worked with multiple departments while at Vacasa as well as programming work for molecular biology labs while at University of Oregon.

At Vacasa I was the primary data scientist working with the operations department and in my last few months I worked with the personalization team in Boise as well. My focus has been on developing all aspects that go into a successful data scientist; from rounding out my engineering skillset for model deployment, improving my public speaking, to finding opportunities for collaboration between teams, I enjoy any chance to challenge myself and go outside my comfort zone!

website: hiranmayiduvvuri.com",Working on Applied Intelligence team,"• Working closely with both software engineers and stakeholders to create machine learning models to help with business needs.
• A big item was significantly improving an old model used to predict cleaning times. Worked with various people in the business to start the initial pass as well as further working on reporting the progress of the model and features chosen. For the project, it was important to be able to present the technical aspects in a way that was understandable for non-technical people. End product was a model widely used by the business.
• Led feature engineering side of data lake project. This was a collaboration between data science and data engineering as a way to set up data as a product within the company. It was also part of an effort to reduce duplicating work among team. Part of the project was standardizing definitions, creating documentation, and presenting.
* As an extension of this, gained experience working with different geo packages in python and working quite a bit with spatial/geographical data.
* Worked with digital team to create a market recommendation model and API. Used FastAPI for deploying. Some challenges were the multi-channel nature of Vacasa and how new some data was. Gained experience on marketing side of the company, working remotely, and how to work with limited data.

As a note, the housekeeping scheduler project and clean time model I worked on have been mentioned in various articles talking about machine learning/AI at Vacasa (such as here: https://travel-hospitality.cioreview.com/cxoinsight/machine-learning-in-an-antiquated-industry-nid-30623-cid-40.html)

I am a scientist, a mathematician, and a programmer. Together, these traits make me a problem solver and a data scientist. I graduated with degrees in kinesiology and data science; two domains which reflect my passionate curiosity and commitment to optimize. I am driven by data science and the power it holds at solving problems and making better decisions. I am independent and can work on my own and take initiative when needed. Having grown up playing team sports, I am also a team player and thrive in groups that move towards a similar goal. I have strong business acumen and can communicate effectively to peers, superiors and stakeholders.

Experience

As an Assistant Instructor for Applied Machine Learning, I helped drive projects like risk management and object detection while also reinforcing foundations of machine learning to other students. As a Data Analyst, I created and refactored corporate reporting dashboard including profit and loss statements and operation expenses. I implemented data models that lowered the cardinality of data by millions of rows improving efficiency and the ability to bring more historical information.

What I Do

I learn techniques and algorithms for machine learning and apply them to solve business problems. For example, I build data transformation pipelines using Python and SQL, processing millions of rows of data which I feed into machine learning models like gradient boosted trees or neural networks. I understand the abstractions of these models, why they are useful, how they can be applied, what parameters are needed, and the positives/negatives or tradeoffs as compared to other models used to solve similar problems. 

The bottom line: I optimize, make predictions, and generate strategic insights for business or research.",Data Scientist for DMED (Digital Media & Entertainment Distribution) under Consumer Experience.

After working with the VR Lab for a year I was asked to return for my final year of school and work on implementing other VR solutions for medical education. I am now developing a pipeline process to take 2-D DICOM images for either CT or MRI data, generate 3D models with segmentation, then use this 3D model in an ultrasound simulation. The simulated ultrasound signal will be generated in unity and paired with haptic feedback devices for first training medical students in how to use an ultrasound, and then for training them on how to use an ultrasound to locate a breast tumor and perform a needle based biopsy.

Technical Experience

This is a brief summary of the languages, frameworks, and patterns I've worked with. I do not consider myself an expert in any of these, nonetheless, I've used about 80% of the below in production settings, often being an early adopter on the team. 

▪ Languages: Python, R, and Scala (i.e., Spark).
▪ Databases: On OLAP side, I know Redshift very well (both as a user and as an administrator), but also worked with BigQuery and Snowflake. For microservice backends, I use PostgreSQL. 
▪ CI/CD: Jenkins, Artifactory, Coveralls, Github Actions
▪ Orchestration frameworks: DBT, Dagster (i.e., an alternative to Airflow)
▪ Infrastructure: AWS (S3, EC2, IAM, Sagemaker, RDS, Redshift, DMS). I know how to interact with infrastructure using Boto and Terraform. I'm also a big fan of Tilt for local Kubernetes development.
▪ Machine Learning: I have very a good foundation on loss functions and optimization functions. On the supervised modeling side, I use Random Forests or GBM. For unsupervised modeling, the techniques I use most often are isolation forests and DBSCAN.
▪ Statistics: Bootstrap techniques and permutation-based techniques. Good familiarity with linear mixed-effects modeling, link functions, how to design A/B tests, and how to monitor experimental results.
▪ Frameworks: On a daily/weekly basis, I use the following: pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, keras, lightgbm, poetry, pytest, hypothesis, pydantic, fastapi, sqlalchemy, alembic. ",,"• Core data scientist on the team building machine learning services that support Earnest underwriting infrastructure.
• Daily experience with microservice development, databases, unit tests, cloud deployment, CI/CD.
* Developed a Python microservice template. This template allows a person on the team to easily build and deploy Python microservices. It comes with ORM, logging, dependency management, and a variety of automation utilities that enable rapid model deployment. 
* Researched, built and deployed an income service model. This model outperformed several 3rd party top tier providers and supports 50% automation in underwriter decision making.
* Researched, built and deployed several models that support our Student Loan Origination product. 
* Researched and built a customer acquisition model that led to a 40% reduction in direct mail marketing costs and outperformed several third-party providers, such as Epic and LendingScience. 
* Wrote a Python microservice that supports dynamic pricing and scoring. It currently is used to score and price $20billion/year student loan volume.
* Supervised the work of 3-4 direct reports (mix of Data Engineers and SWE) by scoping out project requirements, performing sprint reviews, retrospectives, postmortems, and code reviews
* Exposed data from over a dozen microservices in Redshift. Set up the tone for data governance and data documentation.
